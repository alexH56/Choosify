# Choosify

## Project Description
Do you struggle choosing a place to eat? Do you and your significant other go around in circles when picking a restaurant, all the while insisting "anywhere is fine...except there"? Well worry no more! Choosify exists to solve your problem by taking your location, finding the top 100 restaurants near you, choosing one at random, and displaying its information to you. Trust in the app.

## Technologies Used
This project is primarily comprised of Javascript, utilizes the React library, consumes the Yelp Fusion API, routes with React Router, and is styled by SCSS.

## Features
The user will be able to specify their respective city or town. The app will perform a series of API calls to retrieve a list of the top 100 restaurants, as well as specific info for one chosen at random. This info is then displayed to the user along with a review, with the option to view more reviews or click a link to the dedicated Yelp web-page for that restaurant.

## Milestones
I'll first build the landing page and location-based search feature. Following that, I will build out the logic for retrieving the restaurant list, making a random selection, and fetching its details asynchronously. Next I will work on dynamically populating the details page and set up routing, and lastly will focus on styling a simple layout, implementing  SCSS.
